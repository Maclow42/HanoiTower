# Tower of Hanoi

## Overview
This project is an automated solution for the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a varying number of disks of different sizes. The goal is to move the entire stack of disks from one rod to another, adhering to the following rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
